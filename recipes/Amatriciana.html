    <!--Recipe Description-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Substantial, versatile, and fun, this straw-like pasta is shaped like thick spaghetti with a hollow center. The
        name bucatini comes from Italian: buco, meaning “hole”,
        while bucato means “pierced”. The hollow center in bucatini allows it to be fully coated and filled with sauce,
        letting bold, flavorful sauces shine.</p>

    <h3>Steps To Follow</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>

            In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add guanciale and pepper flakes
            and cook, stirring,
            until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
            Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of pan, until nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, boil pasta in salted water until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package
            recommends.
            Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Cook over high heat, stirring
            and tossing rapidly,
            until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened and begins to coat noodles. Remove from heat, add cheese,
            and stir rapidly to incorporate.
            Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.
